It\\'s a model that\\'s trained on data to make predictions or decisions.\\n\\n**How does it work?**\\n\\nImagine you\\'re trying to recognize pictures of cats and dogs. A neural network would be like a team of super-intelligent detectives:\\n\\n1. Each \"detective\" (neuron) looks at an image and says, \"Hmm, I think this is a cat!\"\\n2. The detective checks the picture against a database of known images.\\n3. If the picture matches, the detector says, \"Yes! I\\'ve found a cat!\" and sends a signal to another detector.\\n4. Another detector checks if the new signal came from an actual cat or just a fake.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the detective is sure about the image.\\n\\n**Types of Neural Networks:**\\n\\nThere are many types of neural networks, but the main idea is similar:\\n\\n1. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: Like our detectives, with layers of neurons that process different information.\\n2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: Like a team that follows clues over time, to solve a problem or predict something.\\n\\n**Training and Testing:**\\n\\nTo train a neural network, we feed it data (images) and tell it what\\'s correct or incorrect. After many iterations, the network learns to recognize patterns and make predictions on new data.\\n\\nWhen we test the network with more images, we can see if it accurately identifies the cat pictures!\\n\\n**Real-World Applications:**\\n\\nNeural networks have many exciting applications in fields like:\\n\\n* Image recognition (e.g., self-driving cars)\\n* Speech recognition\\n* Natural language processing\\n\\nIn summary, neural networks are powerful tools that mimic the human brain\\'s ability to learn and make decisions. They\\'re a fundamental part of artificial intelligence research and have numerous practical applications in various fields.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'llama3.2:1b', 'created_at': '2025-06-26T14:34:15.4497091Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 61965166700, 'load_duration': 41619400, 'prompt_eval_count': 47, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1078058100, 'eval_count': 411, 'eval_duration': 60844733700, 'model_name': 'llama3.2:1b'} id='run--95c948c0-ffba-45ed-82cb-6ea35a20e023-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 47, 'output_tokens': 411, 'total_tokens': 458}\n"
